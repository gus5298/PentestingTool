Books and blog articles More about TestSheepNZ ... Mike first became interested in IT when he received his first ZX Spectrum in 1982. Originally programming games, he became more and more interested in using computers to solve problems, starting with his maths homework. This interest led him from modelling Brownian and simple harmonic motion at school, to modelling cometary orbits and signal processing both radio signals from the Sun and opto-electronic sensors before leading to work for military applications in sonar, radar and aircraft avionics. Over the last ten years his work has taken him into both manual and automated testing in increasingly agile working environments, and taking on roles to help coach and mentor teams. He is also a qualified Scrum Master. Never afraid to try his hand at something, Mike has done most roles in IT software from development to requirement gathering, release management, testing, management, coaching. If this makes him sound like an overachiever, fear not - his Achilles heel is trying to play the guitar and read music, for which - after many years of trying in a soundproof basement - he shows absolutely zero aptitude.
