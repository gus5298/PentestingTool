<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Penetration Testing is a complex and time consuming task, but at the same time it is a critical procedure to secure Web Applications and therefore protect their users. The combination of Artificial Intelligence components with traditional Pentesting techniques aims to improve these processes. In this paper, a brute force strategy based on Semantic Clustering will be implemented to prove the concept of leveraging NLP to improve the enumeration stage within Penetration Tests. 

Furthermore, a functional prototype will be developed to assist testers in all main stages of a Penetration test, including vulnerability discovery with a focus on SQLi, and report generation with AI powered summarization. This toolkit generates two reports defined as cheat sheets, in PDF and JSONL (machine readable) format, containing Open Source Intelligence (emails, social media, WHOIS information, etc.) about the target URL, along with the enumeration results. The toolkit will be tested with five demo Web Applications and the outputs compared against two non-AI solutions.   


### Built With


* [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/)
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [OPENAI](https://openai.com/)
* [DIRSEARCH](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In order to run the tool on your system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

The following libraries must be installed eg. via Pip:

```sh

pip install extract-emails
pip install extract-social-media
pip install fpdf
pip install python-whois
pip install nltk
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install python-dateutil
pip install jsonlines
pip install html_to_etree
pip install selenium

  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free OpenAI API Key at [https://beta.openai.com/](https://beta.openai.com/)
2. Clone the repo 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gus5298/PentestingTool
   ```
3. Install the Prerequisistes above.

4. Enter your API in cheatsheet.py and hardcode any other additional settings such as Basic Authentication if desired.
